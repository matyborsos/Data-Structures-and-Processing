    "# ETL Github exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's workout a simple ETL-like pipeline. The goal here is to exercise some Python coding as well as get some intrinsic decision-making on transforming, naming, storing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "> To query for the 100 most starred Python-based repositories created this year, and create (related) tables to represented the (JSON) information.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Important steps:\n",
    "> - save the respective JSON content in individual files in their own directories.\n",
    "> - Download the corresponding readme files, and create an index (of words) relating the most overall frequent words to the repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not interesting in Github's API features, here is the URL to query for such information:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=created:>2023-01-01+language:python&sort=stars&order=desc&per_page=100\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> See below for [an example of such query results](#Example-query-result)\n",
    "\n",
    "The response is composed by some top-level attributes (`total_count`, `incomplete_results`) that are not of our interest here. The contents of `items` is what we want: those are the repositories' metadata we queried for.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Save each `items` metadata block (aka, _object_ in JS) on a `.json` file in a directory named after owner and/or repository name.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Organize such information (i.e., inside `items`) into:\n",
    "  1. a \"main\" table for the _items_, each record represents a repository;\n",
    "    - remove all unnecessary URLs: keep only `home_url`.\n",
    "  2. a \"owners\" table, with the information inside items' `owner` object;\n",
    "    - same for `license` and `topics`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Download corresponding _readme_ files, save them next to metadata's `.json` file.\n",
    "  1. Create an index of words for each _readme_ file and compute words frequencies;\n",
    "  2. Merge them all into one \"index\" table of the (100) most frequent words;\n",
    "    - **Remember**: an _index_ (table) related _word/term_ to _source/location_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "Here is an example of a similar query (`per_page=1`):\n",
